## Why should I use the methods described in this book?

User Need Research helps us find out how and why users do what they do. Why is this important? Using this knowledge we can create products or services that matter for the users and match their needs in daily life.  Even if your idea and the final outcome is actually awesome, it still needs to find its place in the user's life. It can be helpful to consider existing motivations, activities and problems the users have and to know the context the interaction happens in. Will they be motivated or tired? What other products do they use in the situations in which your idea may matter? How may other people influence the interaction?

It can naturally happen that you find out your assumptions about the users are not totally right. This may feel bad at first. But even if the user's actions don't make sense to you immediately, they do make sense for the users. After finding this out, you can adjust your assumptions and build upon your newly gained knowledge. You may also get new ideas by researching your users needs: an unexpected concept a user holds, a clever hack they used to solve a problem may spark new ideas – ideas which will be based on user needs.

## Is this like usability testing?

The methods described in this book are different from common usability testing. Testing is great for finding out about users’ problems, existing bugs and the possibilities to tweak an existing product. However, usability tests tell you little about the »why« and »how« of users’ work.

Often, usability testing is done with a nearly finished product, at a location users come to (like a testing lab) and with set tasks for them to do. The methods I will demonstrate here can be applied if you have a product but also if you only have rough ideas about an area you are interested in designing for. Also, we will strive for getting the information in the context where the interaction usually happens (not in a lab) and observe tasks that the user would just do in contrast to set ones. This allows us to explore the actual actions and the reasons behind them –  because even if you might be puzzled about some things you observe they usually make perfect sense for the users.

## Couldn't I just ask what they want?

Since we talk about finding user needs, an obvious question is if we could not just ask those users what they want and just build it. But this may not be a good idea.

Usually, people want a better version of what they already have.  Henry Ford allegedly said »If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses«. Instead of faster horses, Ford sold a product that satisfied an underlying motivation – getting quickly from A to B – instead of the specific wish.

Getting to know about the underlying motivation (why do they want to get from A to B?), the activities (how do they currently get from A to B) and their problems (what is currently unpleasant about getting from A to B) is what helps us to understand users better.

This does not mean that what people wish can or should be ignored or that some ingenious designer is needed to show them their true needs. I just want to say that asking for needs directly and than just building it is not as simple and helpful as it might seem.


## In which situations/project state can I use these methods?

Methods for finding user needs are usually applied in early project stages. The focus is not on evaluating what has been built, but more on how to improve future designs. So the research takes place before you decide which features go in the product and how they exactly work. Here are some scenarios in which finding out about the how and why about the user's work makes sense:

1. There is a broad topic given which you want to explore further.

> This might be »using libraries« or even »Finding and working with information in media«.

2. You have an idea for a product or a service and you want to find out, what user motivations, activities and problems are important to consider when building this product or service.

> The library wants to create an app for creating bibliographies, and
> they want to find out what they need to consider when doing this

3. An existent product is to be improved or changed.

> The library has an app for creating bibliographies since several years.
> However, there are complaints about it being useless and hard to use;
> Now they want to find out how version 2.0 should be different

Starting with a broad topic, not focused on a solution, may be the ideal (since you can solely focus on the user needs), but it is far more common that a product idea already exists. In the case an *existing* product should be improved, it is common to use usability tests, but it makes sense to combine them with user need research – what about finding out about the usability problems of the current system by observing their everyday tasks?


## Example for User Need Research: e-Learning

Some time ago I did research on the use of computers and web for learning purposes.

At the institution, a web based learning software (an LMS, Learning management system)
was already in place. We assumed that students would probably use it for collaboration,
professors for preparing interactive quizzes for the students and for enabling them to
review material. But we did not want to rely on our guesses, so we did research on how
and why students and teaching staff used computers and the web for learning (note that we
deliberately did research on the use web and computers for learning, instead of focusing
just on the learning software itself).

We recruited students and teaching staff from various courses and interviewed them. The gathered data
was analyzed to find out how and why computers and the Internet were used for learning.

We discovered that  quizzes, workgroups and videos were not so important. We found out that the most important aspect of the system was exchanging files. The following uses of files were typical:

1. Slides (=learning material) sent by the professors or their assistants

2. Texts (=homework) the students sent to the professors or their assistants.

3. Project work of a student group in the specific file formats (if a group worked on images it might be Photoshop® files etc.)

4. Exercise material of students like old exam questions for practice.

In addition, students and teaching staff exchanged messages via mail;
among students, email and Facebook® Messages were  popular, too.

Why did students and teaching staff alike use files and messages instead of
the specialized learning solutions?

All these methods we saw used skills the teaching staff and students already had:
Creating files and exchanging them and writing messages. So a major need was
to get material to students and receive material from them with the least effort
and the least demand for learning new skills. It was the same for the students: They needed
to do their projects and homework as efficiently as possible and they relied
on mail and services like Dropbox^®^ to do project work together or to share old exam
questions for practicing.

This led us to several ideas which guided the project in the following phases:

* Consider file up- and download as a core tool
* Carefully test the solution to make it at least as usable and useful as existing ways of file exchange
* To increase adoption to the new system, ensure that people know about the feasibility for their standard-usecases (Files!) before showing the additional possibilities.
* In general: Keep in mind that change is hard

Even though the study was not too big and the results did not uncover some
totally unexpected perspective on our project, it was completely worth the effort.
We did not need to put lots of money into solving problems that did not even
exist or  remove functions that were critical for our users.

## This text’s structure
I will show you the process of researching the user’s needs in the following chapters of this book. The book is organized in the following sections:

1. Finding Participants for your studies
2. Preparing your research session
3. Gather data by asking questions  and observation
4. Analyzing the gathered data
5. Reporting your results

In each chapter I will give several examples. The examples have their own formatting, it looks like this:


> *This is not a user research interview, but a famous bot chatting with me:*
>
> […]
>
> ELIZA: You seem to be quite positive.
>
> YOU:   I am!
>
> ELIZA: Is it because you are that you came to me ?
>
>[…]


Partly, the examples will draw from a little study about graphic designer’s use of their tools.

Thats about what you should know about the book.
